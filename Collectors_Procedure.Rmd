# Ransomware Collectors

This file indicates (very draftly) the different steps necessary to find ransomware collectors (as explained in the paper). The method consists of taking into account, for each expanded address, all the outgoing transactions and their respective outputs. 

With this, an outgoing-relationships graph can be built for each ransomware family. The nodes in the graph are either the expanded addresses or the addresses receiving money from the expanded addresses. The edges in the graph illustrate the direction of the monetary flow. We consider that each node that has indegree â‰¥ 2, in a family specific outgoing-relationships graph, is a collector address for this ransomware family.

The below R script creates a graph object to calculate the number of in-degree relations an outgoing relationship graph related to a ransomware family.

## Load essential libraries 
```
library(plyr)
library(sna)
library(igraph)
```

## Create a dataframe with the outgoing_relationship file from the data extraction  
```
rel_outgoing <- data.frame(expanded_rel_outgoing)

#rename columns based on what they represent
rel_outgoing<-rename(rel_outgoing, c("X1"="address", "X2"="family", "X3" = "cluster", "X4"="dstAddress", "X5"="estimatedValueUSD", "X6"="estimatedValueSATOSHI", "X7"="noTransactions"))
```

## Create a subset dataframe for each ransomware family (example shown with locky)
```
Locky<-subset(rel_outgoing, rel_outgoing$family == 'Locky')
```
## Shift Columns in the dataframe to have directed relationships
```
Locky<-Locky[,c(1,4,3,2,5,6)]
```

## For each subset dataframe, create a _vertices_ file 
```
locky_vertices1 = unique(Locky[c(1)])
locky_vertices1$source = locky_vertices1$source = 1
#note : all source addresses (addresses that send money) are related to ransomware since they are part of the expanded dataset

locky_vertices2 = unique(Locky[c(2)])
locky_vertices2$source = locky_vertices2$source = 0
locky_vertices2= rename(locky_vertices2, c("dstAddress" = "address", "source"="source"))

locky_vertices = rbind(locky_vertices1, locky_vertices2)
locky_vertices <- locky_vertices[order(locky_vertices$source),] 
locky_vertices<-locky_vertices[ !duplicated(locky_vertices$address), ]

````

## Create a graph object with the dataframe
```
g_Locky<-graph_from_data_frame(Locky, directed=TRUE, vertices= Locky_vertices)
````

## Calculate number of indegree relationships for each vertice in the graph 
```
indegree<-degree(g_Locky,v=V(g_Locky),mode="in")
indegree<-data.frame(indegree)

#Rename columns 
indegree <- cbind(Row.Names = rownames(indegree), indegree)
rownames(indegree) <- NULL
colnames(indegree)<-c("Address", "indegree")

#Rename dataframe 
Locky_relation<-indegree
Locky_relation$family<-"Locky"
````

### Do this for all ransomware families 
_Note: These 4 families are in the blockchain, but do not have outgoing relationships 7ev3n, Bucbi, CryptoHost, CTB-Locker_

## Combine vertice and relation dataframes from each ransomware family into one large file 
```
#Merge each relation dataframes 
All_merged <- rbind(Locky_relation, VenusLocker_relation, Flyper_relation, Cryptohitman_relation, TowerWeb_relation, XTPLocker_relation, Globev3_relation, CryptConsole_relation, NotPetya_relation, APT_relation, WannaCry_relation, DMALocker_relation, GlobeImposter_relation, Exotic_relation, Razy_relation, Xorist_relation, ComradeCircle_relation, Phoenix_relation, Chimera_relation, NullByte_relation, PopCornTime_relation, CryptoLocker_relation, CryptXXX_relation, EDA2_relation, DMALockerv3_relation, Globe_relation, SamSam_relation, JigSaw_relation, NoobCrypt_relation, CryptoTorLocker2015_relation, flyper_relation)

#Merge all vertices DATAFRAME 
all_merged_vertices <- rbind(Locky_vertices, VenusLocker_vertices, Flyper_vertices, Cryptohitman_vertices, TowerWeb_vertices, XTPLocker_vertices, Globev3_vertices, CryptConsole_vertices, NotPetya_vertices, APT_vertices, WannaCry_vertices, DMALocker_vertices, GlobeImposter_vertices, Exotic_vertices, Razy_vertices, Xorist_vertices, ComradeCircle_vertices, Phoenix_vertices, Chimera_vertices, NullByte_vertices, PopCornTime_vertices, CryptoLocker_vertices, CryptXXX_vertices, EDA2_vertices, DMALockerv3_vertices, Globe_vertices, SamSam_vertices, JigSaw_vertices, NoobCrypt_vertices, CryptoTorLocker2015_vertices, flyper_vertices)

#Rename column 
colnames(all_merged_vertices)[1] <- "Address"

#Merge both dataframes
Total<- merge(all_merged, all_merged_vertices, by="Address")

#Remove duplicate rows 
Total[!duplicated(Total), ]
````

## Create a tag on collectors based on whether they are ransomware addresses or not
```
#Create a flag for all addresses that were already in the dataset with indegree > (or equal) to 2
Total$New_collector[(Total$indegree > 1 & Total$source == 0)]<- 1 
Total$New_collector[is.na(Total$New_collector)]<-0

#Create a flag for all addresses not in the dataset with indegree > (or equal) to 2
Total$Collector_in_cluster[(Total$indegree > 1 & Total$source == 1) ] <- 1 
Total$Collector_in_cluster[is.na(Total$Collector_in_cluster)]<-0

#Create a flag for both 
Total_new_collectors<-subset(Total, Total$New_collector==1 | Total$Collector_in_cluster ==1)

```

## Write results in CSV 
```
#Write in csv file 
write.csv(Total_new_collectors, file = "path\document_name.csv")
```
